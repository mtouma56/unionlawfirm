The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Lebanese law firm platform from concept to a near-complete MVP. The work began by adopting a React + FastAPI + MongoDB stack, prioritizing the core case submission system. The development followed an iterative approach, frequently addressing and resolving critical technical issues, notably recurring React Hooks problems in the  frontend and structural JSX errors during footer and navigation implementations. The engineer demonstrated persistence by debugging and retesting until functionalities like multilingual support and mobile UX were validated. Key features like user authentication, case submission with file upload, appointment booking, and comprehensive user/admin dashboards were built. The project now boasts robust multilingual capabilities (English, French, Arabic with RTL support) and an optimized mobile interface. The engineer consistently utilized testing agents to validate progress and identify bugs, ensuring a functional product. The current phase involves expanding content pages and refining navigation.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to create a web and mobile platform for a Lebanese family law firm specializing in divorce, inheritance, custody, and alimony.
**Core Objectives:**
*   **Professional, Modern, Multilingual Website (FR/EN/AR):** The platform needs to support three languages with appropriate UI/UX.
*   **Video Library:** Offer a library of explanatory videos on frequent legal cases.
*   **Online Case Submission:** Allow users to submit cases via a form with file upload (Word, PDF, all image types, Excel).
*   **Appointment Booking:** Enable online appointment scheduling, eventually with online payment.
*   **User Dashboard:** Provide a dashboard for users to track video history, cases, and appointments.
*   **Admin Dashboard:** Comprehensive management for videos, users, cases, and appointments, including status updates (Pending → Under Review → In Progress → Completed/Rejected) and detail modals.
*   **Mobile App via Capacitor:** The project should be prepared for transformation into Android/iOS applications.
**Key Implementation Details So Far:**
*   **Homepage:** Professional design with hero section and services.
*   **Authentication:** Simple email/password signup/login.
*   **Case Submission:** Form with multi-format file upload.
*   **Appointment Booking:** Basic system with consultation fees (Stripe integration pending).
*   **Dashboards:** User dashboard for tracking, full admin dashboard with case management.
*   **Multilingual Support:** Implemented for English (default), French, and Arabic (with RTL support) across navigation, homepage, authentication, forms, and buttons.
*   **Mobile UX:** Optimized language selector and general responsiveness for mobile.
*   **Footer:** A professional, multilingual, responsive footer with contact info, services, quick links, and social media. Issues with double footers and positioning on login/register pages were fixed. The Union Law Firm name/logo is now clickable to return to the homepage.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: This is the main React component, serving as the application's single page. It manages routing using a  state, handles user authentication (login/register), renders different views (home, videos, case submission, booking, user dashboard, admin dashboard, and newly added pages like About Us, Contact, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service), and manages global states for loading, user data, and errors. It integrates  for multilingual support and contains all page rendering logic and component interactions.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: This is the main FastAPI application. It defines all backend API endpoints, handles user authentication (registration, login) using JWT, manages case submissions with file uploads, and provides endpoints for user and admin dashboards (e.g., fetching cases, updating case statuses, managing videos). It connects to MongoDB and handles CORS.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Setup of authentication endpoints (, ).
        -   Endpoints for case submission, including file upload handling to the  directory.
        -   Endpoints for managing appointments, fetching user-specific data, and admin functionalities.
        -   Addition of a default admin account ( / ) for testing and initial setup.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Contains global and component-specific styles, primarily using Tailwind CSS directives. It's crucial for the application's visual appearance and responsiveness.
